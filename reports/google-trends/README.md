# Introduction

Google trends has a wealth of information on specific keywords. Even if we take a simple query like 'food', we can answer questions such as: 

- What are the most popular related queries? 'food near me', 'chinese food', 'fast food', 'dog food'?
- How much has the interest in 'food' changed over time?
- Which countries or states is the keyword most popular in?

If you want to dig into your own brand, favourite sports team, or a market segment, answering these questions will give you real, data-driven insights into who cares about your topic and how it's changing over time. 

If you are comfortable writing Python, you have everything in your toolkit to analyse and visualise the data already.

Instead of having to manually work with Google's APIs, this notebook works with the fantastic `pytrends` library toÂ answer the questions above in a couple of lines of code. It allows a simple interface for automating the downloading of data from Google Trends.
