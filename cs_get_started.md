# Welcome to our Codespace!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

If you're reading this, you probably just followed a link to try out Datapane using Codespaces.

If that's the case, you are in a development environment that's hosted in the cloud, with all the libraries installed for you to use Datapane right now.

The best place to get started is by running through our [Quickstart Notebook](./quickstart.ipynb) which will help you build your first report and app and introduce you to Datapane concepts.
